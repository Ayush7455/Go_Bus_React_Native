# Go Bus - A Bus Tracking Application
Go Bus is a bus tracking application built using React Native. The app has two logins: one for the admin and one for the driver. The admin is responsible for registering the bus and the driver updates the bus location. The bus location is updated in Firestore, which allows the admin to track the bus using the "Track Bus" feature in the admin portal.
